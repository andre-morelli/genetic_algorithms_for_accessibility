# Genetic Algorithms for Accessibility
This repository contains the computational tools used to write the manuscrip with the title "Assessing Potential for Accessibility and Equality in Transit Systems: An Evolutionary Algorithm-Driven Method" currently under review.
Ask the authors for citing options before using this code on research projects through andre.morelli@usp.br.

For an example of how to use a Genetic Algorithm to optimize accessibility, see `example.ipynb`
